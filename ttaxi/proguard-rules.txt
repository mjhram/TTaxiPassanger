# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in /home/mendhak/Programs/Android/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

-keep class com.google.android.gms.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.

#When optimizing your application with ProGuard, include the following rules to prevent logback-android and SLF4J calls from being removed (unless that's desired):
-keep class ch.qos.** { *; }
-keep class org.slf4j.** { *; }
-keepattributes *Annotation*
#If you don't use the mailing features of logback (i.e., the SMTPAppender), you might encounter an error while exporting your app with ProGuard. To resolve this, add the following rule:
-dontwarn ch.qos.logback.core.net.*

#Fabric: Weâ€™ve made it simple to set up ProGuard and Dexguard to automatically upload your mapping.txt file to de-obfuscate your crash reports.
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable,*Annotation*
#If you are using custom exceptions, add this line so that custom exception types are skipped during obfuscation:
-keep public class * extends java.lang.Exception

#to stop the onEvent methods being stripped out:
#https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/issues/6
-keepclassmembers class ** {
    public void onEvent(**);
}
-keepclassmembers class ** {
public void onEventMainThread(**);
}
-keepclassmembers,includedescriptorclasses class ** { public void onEvent*(**); }

#Fix crash when open profile activity
#For design support library
-keep class android.support.design.widget.** { *; }
-keep interface android.support.design.widget.** { *; }
